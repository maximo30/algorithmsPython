# Time Complexity: O(n^3)
#  Taking into consideration that what takes
#  O(n^3) is the call to np.linalg.inv in the worst case scenario
# Space Complexity: O(n)
#  where n is the size of the input matrix

# Solution description:
#  I am taking the input and treating it  as a Absorbing Markov Chain,
#  in which each "Terminate Markov State" is an absorbing node (a node which
#  has no output). Instead of calculating all the probabilities in which T0 - Tk
#  (being T one count on each change of state), there is a mathematical proof in
#  which the absorbing probabilities for every other node to any other node in the
#  Chain = (I - Q)^-1. I = Identity  Matrix, Q (a generated probability matrix),
#  to the inverse. Since we are only interested in S0, I take the first row
#  of that matrix and we have our result. The terminate state nodes are the ones
#  in the input matrix with row's = 0. We compute the Greatest Common Denominator in
#  order to display the result.
